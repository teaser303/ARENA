        "6. Give contextual information (e.g. what the output will be used for, the end goal of the task, what a successful task completion looks like)\n",
        "7. Directly instruct it to do or avoid something if it makes the same error.\n",
        "\n",

        "A main flaw of model-generated questions is the lack of diversity. The questions might follow the same format and a bit cookie-cutter, whereas ideally, we want a heterogenous set of questions so the style pattern is not a confounder to our results.\n",
        "\n",
        "One solution to this problem is to add **variance prompts**. These are additional instructions we design to add to the user prompt, for the purpose of introducing variations in its responses. They can instruct the model to generate questions about a particular context, or be more creative. Some examples:\n",
        "\n",
        "- \"Look at these example questions and identify any patterns that make them repetitive. Then think of different kinds of questions that break these patterns.\"\n",
        "- \"Design questions that introduce unusual or unexpected contexts to test adaptability.\"\n",
        "- \"Make your questions really simple and straightforward.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "The idea isn't to uniformly improve questions, but rather provide more different question archetypes. You should fill in the `add_variance_prompts` function below, which randomly selects and appends these variance prompts to the user prompt with some probability `p_var` (i.e. with this probability we select exactly one of the variance prompts uniformly at random and append it to the user prompt).\n",
        "\n",
        "When you've finished the function, you should run the code below to experiment with different variance prompts, and make sure they increase diversity without significantly reducing the quality of model output. Importantly, note how we need to make sure each question is generated from a different sample of the variance prompts, otherwise the whole point of using variance prompts for increased diversity is lost."

        "One tool that massively aids us during evals work is **concurrency** (multiple computations happening at once). Since most of our code is bottlenecked by waiting to receive responses from the LLM, we could in theory send multiple requests at once without having to wait for each one to be fully returned.\n",
        "\n",
        "`ThreadPoolExecutor` is a set of functions in Python's `concurrent.future` module that allows functions to be executed concurrently. It assigns each run of the function to a separate CPU core or \"worker\", each executes the function on its own \"thread\". This will greatly increase the speed of generating a large number of questions. For a more detailed tutorial, see [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/191nobMLWeaCAB6i5gQJ3We0qcPjvu_dM?usp=sharing) - note that concurrency is a very deep topic in programming that we'll barely scratch the surface of here.\n",

        "The basic syntax for using `ThreadPoolExecutor` that we'll be using is:\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, `function_to_execute` could be a function that queries the LLM, and `input_args` could be a list of different prompts to query with. The `results` object will be an iterator containing the results of each function call. You can find more documentation on `executor.map()` [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html).\n",
        "\n",
        "Run the code below to see how it works for a simple example function. You should see that the first three calls to `add_numbers` are executed concurrently (in approximately 2 seconds), but the 4th is executed in 4 seconds - this is because we have `max_workers=3`, so one of the first three computations has to be finished before the 4th can be started.\n",

        "Partly this depends on the nature of your task. If the task is CPU-bottlenecked (e.g. data processing or encryption) then you should generally not use more workers than you have CPU cores (you can find this with the `os.cpu_count()` function). However in our case (querying from an LLM API), the task is I/O (input-output) bottlenecked, and so we don't really need to worry about this as an upper bound. The main considerations are **system network capacity** and most importantly **API rate limits** - if you start hitting rate limit errors, that's when you should be decreasing the number of workers. We recommend using a conservative value in the range of 6-10.\n",
