        "This takes you through what a **computational graph** is, and the basics of how gradients can be backpropagated through such a graph. You'll also implement the backwards versions of some basic functions: if we have tensors `output = func(input)`, then the backward function of `func` can calculate the grad of `input` as a function of the grad of `output`.\n",

        "\n",
        "This section goes into more detail on the backpropagation methodology. In order to find the `grad` of each tensor in a computational graph, we first have to perform a **topological sort** of the tensors in the graph, so that each time we try to calculate `tensor.grad`, we've already computed all the other gradients which are used in this calculation. We end this section by writing a `backprop` function, which works just like the `tensor.backward()` method you're already used to in PyTorch.\n",

        "\n",
        "In this section, we build your own equivalents of `torch.nn` features like `nn.Parameter`, `nn.Module`, and `nn.Linear`. We can then use these to build our own neural network to classify MINST data.\n",

        ">\n",
        "> * Implement more forward and backward functions, including for indexing, summing, and matrix multiplication\n",

        "\n",
        "Before we go through the next exercises, we'll need to address one important topic in tensor operations - **broadcasting**. We've discussed it in earlier exercises, but we're reviewing it here because it's very important for backprop. If you're comfortable with the topic, feel free to jump forwards to the section \"Why do we need broadcasting for backprop?\".\n",
        "\n",
        "Both NumPy and PyTorch have the same rules for broadcasting. When two tensors are involved in an elementwise operation, NumPy/PyTorch tries to broadcast them (i.e. copying them along dimensions) so that they both have the same shape. The rules of broadcasting are as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. You can prepend dummy dimensions (of size 1) to the start of a tensor until both have the same number of dimensions\n",
        "2. After this point, if some dimension has size 1 in one of the tensors, it can be repeated until it matches the size of the corresponding dimension in the other tensor\n",
        "\n",
        "To give a simple example - suppose we have a 2D batch of data, of shape `data.shape = (N, k)` (i.e. we have `N` separate datapoints, each being a vector of length `k`). Suppose we want to add a vector `vec` of length `k` to each datapoint. This is a valid operation, because when we try and add these two objects together:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. `vec` gets prepended with a dummy dimension so it has shape `(1, k)` and both are 2D\n",
        "2. `vec` gets repeated along the first dimension so it has shape `(N, k)`, matching the shape of `data`\n",
        "\n",
        "Then, our output has shape `(N, k)`, and elements `output[i, j] = data[i, j] + vec[j]`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Broadcasting can be a very easy place to make mistakes, because it's easy to lose track of the exact shape of your tensors involved. As a warm-up exercise, below are some examples of broadcasting. Can you figure out which are valid, and which will raise errors?\n",

When we copy `x` along axes to create `x_b`, we're essentially creating multiple pathways for each element of `x` to affect the final loss: one path for each time the element of `x` was copied. So when we change some element of `x`, this causes a first-order change in the loss from all of these different pathways, and we have to sum these changes to get the total first-order change (i.e. the derivative).

We've so far assumed that the final node `L` in the computational graph is a scalar, and all gradients (i.e. the `grad_out` input to our backward functions and the output of our backward functions) are gradients of `L`. In this case, it would make sense to set `grad_out = [1]` for the first backward function call, since we're computing $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial L} = 1$. But what about cases like the one above, when our final node `g` might not be a scalar?\n",

This is called the **directional derivative**. We then compute all tensor gradients using `L` as our final node. For example, this means that in our first gradient calculation (where `g` is the output and `f` is the input) we'll use `grad_out = dL/dg = v`. You don't really need to worry about this, because most of the time (including in the exercise below) we'll just be using the default behaviour where `v` is a tensor of 1s - this is equivalent to `L = g.sum()`."

Note that `requires_grad` does not necessarily mean that we will save the accumulated gradients to this tensor's `.grad` parameter when doing backprop - for example we require gradients to propagate through the hidden activations of a neural network to get back to grads for our model weights, but we don't need to actually store the gradients of the hidden activations.\n",

So our backprop algorithm will always terminate at a leaf node, then store that leaf node's gradient as `.grad` only if `requires_grad` is true.\n",

Here, the `end_grad` argument you pass to `backward` gives you the option to override this default behaviour, in other words if it's supplied you should use it as the first input to your backward function instead of a tensor of 1s.

        "Recall that when we looked at broadcasting, the backwards operation was summing over the broadcasted dimensions. This is because a broadcast operation effectively copies our tensor, giving it more gradient paths that we need to sum over. Similarly, the backwards operation for summing is broadcasting. We can intuitively see this as follows: if we have some value `L = L(x_summed)` where `x_summed` is the result of summing `x` over some number of dimensions, then editing `x_summed[i, j, ...] += delta` has the same downstream effect as editing any one of the `x` values which were summed over to get `x_summed[i, j, ...]`. So to get the gradient of `L` wrt `x`, we need to copy (broadcast) the gradient of `L` wrt `x_summed` up to the full size of `x`.\n",

        "2. **Broadcasting along dims that were summed over**. Since after step (1) you've effectively reduced to the `keepdim=True` case, you can now use `np.broadcast_to` to get the correct shape.\n",

The inplace operation `+=` is supported, since under the hood this calls `__iadd__` which we've defined in our `Tensor` class (same for subtraction, the underlying method here is `__isub__`). Note that we did discuss earlier how inplace operations are very risky for backprop, this is generally true however here we're using it for parameter updates which aren't meant to be differentiated and which are performed just before zeroing all gradients - this makes it safe in this particular context."
